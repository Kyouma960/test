I didn’t really need to study much to achieve them; instead, I learned how to work within the gaps of the education system. I performed well in exams, consistently received top grades, and maintained straight A’s. Other than that, there wasn’t anything particularly interesting about this part of my life that I can share here.",

        description: `2023 was a big shift. I had to move, adapt to a new environment, and realize that being my old self wouldn’t cut it here, or with the present time. I was previously surrounded by an environment that didn’t really require me to grow. I was already one of the top students, and that was enough back then.

That changed when I met some crazy skilled people. They were the best in their own fields, and for the first time, I realized I didn’t even know the ceiling of skill could be this high. I needed to adapt. I needed to learn. I needed to grow.

The uncomfortableness was at its peak, but the grit to improve and adapt was stronger than the pain of staying uncomfortable. And in five years, I’ll be writing about formal experience here, like the idols I’m trying to catch up to.`,
